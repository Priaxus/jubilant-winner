# 5LE - Cognitive Aspects

## What is cognition?

Often described as cognitive processes:

- Attention - abilitiy to choose and concentrate on specific stimuli
    - Selecting what to concentrate on at a point in time from the mass of stimuli around
    - Allows focius on relevant information
- Perception - ability to become aware of something using the senses
    - using bordering helps searching
    - contrasting colours hinders it
    - Icons should enable users to readily distinguish their meaning
        - affordance refers to the actionable properties
        - make use of metaphors and affordances folliwing conventions
    - Text should be legible and stand out from background
- Memory - ability to record information with the facility to recall it later at will
    - Organised in chunks described by their activation
    - Involves first encoding and then retrieving knowledge
    - Practice, recency and context can influence retriving information
    - People are MUCH better at recognising than recalling things
- Learning - aquisition of knowledge or skills through study or experience
- Reading/speaking/listening
- Problem solving, planning reasoning & decision making

## Cognitive challenges in design 
- Conceptual complexity
- Memory load
- Attention/distraction handling

## Recognition vs Recall
- People favour recognition over recall
- Memory involves 2 processes
    - recall-directed
    - recognition-based scanning
- digital content

## Design Implications
### Memory
- Use simple procedures to cary out tasks
- promote recognition rather than recall by using menus and icons and consistently placed elements
- provide a variety of wats of encoding informatino mnemonically including time stamping, categorising, tagging and attributiion (colour, text, icon, sound, image)

## Learning and Errors
- People like learning by doing
- Behaviour of expert vs non expert users is drastically different
- Metaphors and affordances

- Errors are very common and can take up to 30% of interaction time

Errors should be treated as key usability targets
It is important to understand:
1. Kinds of errors and their causes
2. Prevention and Detection mechanisms
3. Methids to minimise consequences

### guidelines for error messages
`Shneiderman`
- Offer simple error handling (step by step instructions)
    - flag text fields that are bad
- Permit easy reversal of actions 
    - Relieves anxiety and promotes exploration

---

Error messages should be:
- Explicit
- Visible
- Human Readable
- Precise
- Constructive

Also:
- Preserve as much of the user's work as possible
- Reduce workload to correct error
- Teach users a bit about how the system works

`Nielsen's first and second law of computer documentation`
1. People don't read it
2. People only read it when they need to recover from an error
## Learning Implications


# Cognitive Frameworks
#### Mental models
Internal constructions of some aspect of the wxternal world allowing predictions to be made

##### Gulfs of execution and evaluation

It is important to make these 'bridges' as small as possible - it maeks it easier for the user to interact with the system
