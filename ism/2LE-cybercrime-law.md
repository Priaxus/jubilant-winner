# Definitions of Cyber Crime
**Cybercrime is an act that violates the law, which is perpetrated using informationand communication technology (ICT) to either target networks, systems, data,websites and/or technology or facilitate a crime**

**Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computerinformation and systems**

## Europol Cyber Crime Classifications
### Cyber-dependent
Any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology
#### Examples: Hacking, (D)DoS, Malware (Creation, Possession, Distribution, Use), Vandalism (Website Defacement)

### Cyber-enabled
Traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technologies

(This means a type of crime that has been happening for ages but tech has allowed it to evolve)

---

Cyber Crime more generally defines activities that target information

Those types of crime where a computer or any other electronic device is involved in order to perform the crime or as the target of it are considered as computer crimes `Source: Parliamentary Office, 2006`

## Traditional Crime vs Cyber Crime
Traditional crimes accquired a new dimension in the cyber world
Computers can be the tool or target of criminal activity

### Traditional Crime:
- Typically have to be present at the crime scene
- Only one offence can be committed at once
### Cyber Crime
- Do not need to be close to the crime scene
- May never need to travel to target location
- Can attack large number of targets globally
- Can require low effort and be low risk

## Cyber-dependent Crimes

### Denial of Service
Used to deny access to specific resources by overwhelming a target with connection requests. Commonlly a SYN flood.

Motives can include: Prevention of legitimate network traffic, disruption of service, access prevention, accessibility prevention

### Malware
Malware can be categorised into various groups, i.e.:
- Infectious Malware
    - Virus
    - Worm
    - Ransomware
        - Cryptoransomware
        - Doxware
- Concealment
    - Trojan Horses
    - Root Kits
    - Backdoors

To detect malware:
- Monitor network traffic
- Monitor unusually high resource usage
- Monitor unusual processes
> Malware can hide but it must also run

## Challenges combating cyber crime
- Technical
    - Attribution
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Virtualised infrastructure
- Legal
    - transnational crime/jurisdictional issues
    - differing international standards of evidence
    - data protection and human rights law varies globally
- Ethical
- Operational
    - Working with international agencies is more difficult than working with your own country's agencies

# Law and Ethics
Look into Lessig's Framework
Number of things that influence cyber regulation:
- Law
- Technical constraints of code
- Market/Economic forces
- Norms/Ethics

## Computer Misuse Act 1990 (Last amended in 2014)

Law passed to create offences related to computers. Heavily cricised as being severly out of date.

## Human Rights Act 1998
- Article 8: Respect for your private and family life, home and correspondence
    - This means that no public authority can interfere with private and family life without reasonable justification
- Article 10: Freedom of expression

## Investigatory Powers Act 2016

:link: [Useful explanatory document](https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/NAFN%20Investigatory%20Powers%20Act%20Guidance%20Booklet.pdf)

:::info
Introduced new powers and consolidated existing ones for use by UKIC and law enforcement organisations to carry out targeted interception of communications, bulk collection of communications data and bulk interception of communications.

Provides for the powers under which law enforcement, the security and intelligence agencies, local authorities and wider public authorities can acquire communications data.
:::

- Created an Investigatory Powers Commmission (IPC) to oversee the use of investigatory powers
- Requires ISPs to retain british internet users' Internet Connection Records (ICRs). These detail which websites a user visits but not the specific pages of each website
- ICRs can be requested WITHOUT a warrant by police and UKIC but also many government agencies as outlined by Schedule 4 of the act. This is highly contentious as these include things like HMRC, Food Standards Agency & Department for Work & Pensions
    - ISPs MUST comply with these requests
    - It is an offence for them to reveal that they have been asked for these records

## Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
- Partially repealed and replaced by IPA 2016 but still partially in force
- Section 49 allows for the police, HMRC or the NCA to issue a disclosure notice, this requires a person to unlock/decrypt an electronic device/data. To be issued, the following have to be met:
    - Police believe you have the password/decryption key
    - It is necessary
        - in the interests of national security
        - to prevent or detect crime
        - in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK
    - It is a proportionate measure
    - It is not reasonably practical for them to obtain the data using other methods
