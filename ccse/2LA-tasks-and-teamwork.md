###### tags: `CCSE` `Week 2` `Lab`

:::info
- **Date:** Oct 15, 2021
- **Summary:**
    - Went through task management
    - Had first group meeting (minutes recorded on different note)
:::

## Task Management
- aim to discuss how we are going to manage our group project

### Task definition:
- Scope of task - must be clear to other team members what needs to be done
- a summary of steps needed to complete the task
- ownership of a task
- due date
    - double the amount of time you think it will take - life happens

:::danger
Bad tasks: 
- "I am going to start coding x" - this is too vague
- "I am going to code the airlock control system" - too big

## User stories

| User Story Reference | *                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Summary              | "As a `role` I want `goal` so that `benefit`"    |
| Acceptance Criteria  | Acceptance Criteria 1: `insert criteria here`    |
| Definition of done   | Acceptance Criteria met<br>Unit tests successful |

## Kanban
* No sprint as such, improvents are delivered on a continual basis
* **No. of tasks  assigned to an individual is strictly limited**
* Tasks are defined in "user stories" and broken down into manageable chunks
* Most suited for environments where workloads and environments frequently change

## What is 'done'?
It is important to get a clear understanding of what it means when someone says a task is done.
This could mean they have finished coding.
This could mean they have fully tested the code and it is ready to be made live.
You get the point.
